#The directive AuthType will enable the mod_auth_form authentication when set to the value form. 
#The directives AuthFormProvider and AuthUserFile specify that usernames and passwords should be checked against the chosen file.
#The directives Session and SessionCookieName session stored within an HTTP cookie on the browser. 
#For more information on the different options for configuring a session, read the documentation for mod_session.
#You can optionally add a SessionCryptoPassphrase to create an encrypted session cookie. 
#This required the additional module mod_session_crypto be loaded.
#In the simple example above, a URL has been protected by mod_auth_form, 
#but the user has yet to be given an opportunity to enter their username and password. 
#Options for doing so include providing a dedicated standalone login page for this purpose, or for providing the login page inline.
