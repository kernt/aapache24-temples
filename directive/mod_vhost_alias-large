VirtualDocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/vhosts/%3+/%2.1/%2.2/%2.3/%2"

# As such, one can make a configuration that will direct all first, second or third level subdomains to the same directory:
VirtualDocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/vhosts/%-2.0.%-1.0"

#For IP-based virtual hosting you might use the following in your configuration file:

UseCanonicalName DNS
VirtualDocumentRootIP "/usr/local/apache/vhosts/%1/%2/%3/%4/docs"
VirtualScriptAliasIP  "/usr/local/apache/vhosts/%1/%2/%3/%4/cgi-bin"

#If you want to include the . character in a VirtualDocumentRoot directive, 
#but it clashes with a % directive, you can work around the problem in the following way:

VirtualDocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/vhosts/%2.0.%3.0"

# A request for http://www.domain.example.com/directory/file.html will be satisfied by the file 
# /usr/local/apache/vhosts/domain.example/directory/file.html.
